called `dog`. This table, `dog`, has been normalized to 3NF.

`dog`, `breedLookup` and `colorLookup`. All output normally
seen in a terminal will be in `java-srv/log` which will dump to the screen. The project may seem to hang but the logs from the container must be written to the project this can take up to 3 min.
